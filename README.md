# arch-factorio-stable-headless
A MakePKG package that automatically updates Factorio Server to the latest stable version, for ArchLinux

The majority of this package comes from https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/factorio-headless

I've only edited the PKGBUILD and uploaded it here, while the AUR changes are being done
